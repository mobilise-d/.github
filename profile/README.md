# Mobilise-D

> [!NOTE]
> **The Alpha release of the Mobilise-D Python pipeline is now available! [Click here](https://github.com/mobilise-d/mobgap)**


## The Mobilise-D Algorithms

We published two versions of the Mobilise-D algorithm pipeline on Github:

1. [New Python Implementation of the Mobilise-D method (mobgap)](https://github.com/mobilise-d/mobgap) (**Currently in early alpha**):
   This is the recommended way to use the Mobilise-D method.
2. [Original Matlab Implementation of the best performing algorithms](https://github.com/mobilise-d/Mobilise-D-TVS-Recommended-Algorithms):
   This should be used as reference to replicate published results of the Mobilise-D consortiom
